## üöÄ Daily Workflow

### **Morning Routine - Always Start Fresh**
```bash
# 1. Switch to main and get latest changes
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Create or switch to your feature branch
git checkout -b feature/test-user-registration
# OR if branch exists: git checkout your-existing-branch
```

### **During Development**
```bash
# Check what you've changed
git status
git diff

# Stage and commit frequently (every 30-60 minutes)
git add .
git commit -m "Add user registration page object

- Create RegistrationPage.ts with form selectors
- Add validation methods for email and password"

# Push regularly to backup your work
git push origin feature/test-user-registration
```

### **Before Going Home**
```bash
# Make sure all work is saved and pushed
git add .
git commit -m "WIP: working on registration form validation"
git push origin feature/test-user-registration
```

---

## üåø Branch Management

### **Branch Naming Convention**
```bash
# Feature branches
feature/add-login-tests
feature/checkout-flow-automation
feature/user-profile-tests

# Bug fixes
fix/login-button-disabled
fix/timeout-issue-chrome
fix/flaky-test-stabilization

# Maintenance
chore/update-playwright-version
chore/cleanup-test-data
docs/update-readme

# CI/CD related
ci/add-test-parallelization
ci/improve-reporting
```

### **Branch Lifecycle**
```bash
# 1. Create branch from latest main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature

# 2. Work on your feature
# ... make changes ...

# 3. Keep branch updated (daily)
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/your-feature
git merge main

# 4. When feature is complete
git push origin feature/your-feature
# Create Pull Request on GitHub

# 5. After merge, cleanup
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feature/your-feature
```

---

## üìù Commit Best Practices

### **Commit Message Format**
```bash
# Good examples
git commit -m "Add login test for valid user credentials

- Test successful login with valid email/password
- Verify redirect to dashboard after login
- Add assertions for welcome message display"

git commit -m "Fix flaky test in checkout process

- Increase wait time for payment modal
- Add explicit wait for loading spinner
- Update selectors for new UI changes"

git commit -m "Update Playwright configuration

- Increase test timeout from 30s to 45s
- Enable trace collection for failed tests
- Configure Chrome browser for CI environment"
```

### **What Makes a Good Commit**
- **Single purpose**: One logical change per commit
- **Descriptive title**: Clear summary in present tense
- **Detailed body**: Explain what and why, not how
- **Test impact**: Mention if tests are added/modified

### **Commit Size Guidelines**
```bash
# ‚úÖ Good - Small, focused commits
git add tests/Login.spec.ts
git commit -m "Add basic login test cases"

git add pages/LoginPage.ts
git commit -m "Create login page object model"

# ‚ùå Bad - Everything in one commit
git add .
git commit -m "Fixed everything and added new features"
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Preventing Merge Conflicts

### **High-Risk Files in Our Project**
These files are commonly edited and cause conflicts:
- `playwright.config.ts` - Test configuration
- `.github/workflows/playwright-chrome-tests.yml` - CI pipeline
- `package.json` - Dependencies
- `test-data/qa/testUser.json` - Test data
- `test-data/dev/testUser.json` - Test data

### **Prevention Strategies**

#### **1. Sync Frequently**
```bash
# Every morning before starting work
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout your-branch
git merge main

# Before making changes to high-risk files
git pull origin main
git merge main
```

#### **2. Communicate with Team**
```bash
# Before editing shared files, announce it
# Slack: "Working on playwright.config.ts for the next hour"
# Or check recent commits: git log --oneline -10
```

#### **3. Small, Focused Changes**
```bash
# ‚úÖ Good - One config change at a time
git commit -m "Increase test timeout to 45 seconds"

# ‚ùå Bad - Multiple unrelated changes
git commit -m "Update config, add new tests, fix bugs"
```

#### **4. Review Recent Changes**
```bash
# Before editing, see what others changed recently
git log --oneline -10 -- playwright.config.ts
git log --oneline -10 -- .github/workflows/
```

---

## üîß Resolving Conflicts

### **When Conflicts Happen**
```bash
# You'll see this message
Auto-merging playwright.config.ts
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in playwright.config.ts
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

### **Step-by-Step Resolution**

#### **1. Identify Conflicted Files**
```bash
git status
# Shows files with conflicts
```

#### **2. Open Files and Look for Conflict Markers**
```javascript
// playwright.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  timeout: 30 * 1000,
<<<<<<< HEAD
  retries: 2,  // Your change
=======
  retries: 1,  // Their change
>>>>>>> main
  reporter: 'html',
});
```

#### **3. Decide What to Keep**
```javascript
// Option 1: Keep your change
export default defineConfig({
  timeout: 30 * 1000,
  retries: 2,
  reporter: 'html',
});

// Option 2: Keep their change
export default defineConfig({
  timeout: 30 * 1000,
  retries: 1,
  reporter: 'html',
});

// Option 3: Combine both (if logical)
export default defineConfig({
  timeout: 30 * 1000,
  retries: process.env.CI ? 1 : 2,  // Different for CI vs local
  reporter: 'html',
});
```

#### **4. Remove Conflict Markers and Test**
```bash
# Remove all <<<<<<< ======= >>>>>>> markers
# Save the file
# Test that it works
npm run test

# If tests pass, commit the resolution
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict in playwright.config.ts

- Keep increased retry count for local development
- Maintain CI optimization from main branch"
```

### **Using VS Code for Conflicts**
VS Code shows conflicts with helpful buttons:
- **Accept Current Change** (your change)
- **Accept Incoming Change** (their change)
- **Accept Both Changes** (combine them)
- **Compare Changes** (see side-by-side)

## üéØ Project-Specific Guidelines

### **Testing Workflow**
```bash
# When adding new test files
git checkout -b test/add-checkout-tests

# Work on tests
# 1. Create page objects first
git add pages/CheckoutPage.ts
git commit -m "Add checkout page object model"

# 2. Add test data if needed
git add test-data/qa/checkout-user.json
git commit -m "Add test data for checkout scenarios"

# 3. Create actual tests
git add tests/Checkout.spec.ts
git commit -m "Add checkout flow test cases

- Test successful checkout with valid payment
- Test checkout with invalid card details
- Test checkout cancellation flow"

# 4. Update configuration if needed
git add playwright.config.ts
git commit -m "Add checkout project configuration"
```

### **CI/CD Workflow Changes**
```bash
# When modifying GitHub Actions
git checkout -b ci/improve-test-reporting

# Make small, incremental changes
git add .github/workflows/playwright-chrome-tests.yml
git commit -m "Add test result summary to workflow"

# Test the workflow
git push origin ci/improve-test-reporting
# Check GitHub Actions to see if it works

# If it works, continue with more changes
git commit -m "Add artifact upload for failed tests"
```

### **Configuration Changes**
```bash
# Before changing playwright.config.ts
git pull origin main  # Get latest version

# Make focused changes
git add playwright.config.ts
git commit -m "Enable trace collection for failed tests only"

# Test locally
npm run test

# Push immediately to avoid conflicts
git push origin your-branch
```

## ‚ö° Quick Reference

### **Essential Daily Commands**
```bash
# Morning setup
git checkout main && git pull origin main

# Create new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Check status
git status

# Stage and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"

# Sync with main (daily)
git checkout main && git pull origin main
git checkout your-branch && git merge main

# Push work
git push origin your-branch-name

# Create Pull Request on GitHub
```

### **Information Commands**
```bash
# See recent commits
git log --oneline -10

# See what changed in a file
git log --oneline -5 -- playwright.config.ts

# See current branch
git branch

# See all branches
git branch -a

# See changes since last commit
git diff

# See staged changes
git diff --cached
```

### **Emergency Commands**
```bash
# Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo last commit (lose changes) - BE CAREFUL!
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Discard local changes in a file
git checkout -- filename.js

# Discard all local changes - BE CAREFUL!
git reset --hard HEAD

# See what would be deleted
git clean -n

# Actually delete untracked files
git clean -f
```

---

## üö® Emergency Scenarios

### **"I Committed to Main by Mistake"**
```bash
# If you haven't pushed yet
git reset --soft HEAD~1  # Undo commit, keep changes
git checkout -b feature/my-changes  # Create proper branch
git add .
git commit -m "Move changes to proper branch"

# If you already pushed to main - contact team lead!
```

### **"I Have Conflicts and Don't Know What to Do"**
```bash
# Step 1: Don't panic!
git status  # See which files have conflicts

# Step 2: Open VS Code
code .  # Use VS Code's conflict resolution UI

# Step 3: For each conflicted file:
# - Look for <<<<<<< ======= >>>>>>> markers
# - Decide what to keep
# - Remove the markers
# - Save the file

# Step 4: Test your changes
npm run test

# Step 5: Commit the resolution
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
```

### **"I Lost My Changes"**
```bash
# Git rarely loses data - check reflog
git reflog  # Shows all recent actions

# Find your lost commit
git checkout <commit-hash>

# Create a new branch from there
git checkout -b recover-my-work
```

### **"My Branch is Behind and Has Conflicts"**
```bash
# Option 1: Merge (preserves history)
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout your-branch
git merge main
# Resolve conflicts, then commit

# Option 2: Rebase (cleaner history, more advanced)
git checkout your-branch
git rebase main
# Resolve conflicts, then: git rebase --continue
```

## üìö Learning Resources

### **Visual Git Tools**
- **GitHub Desktop**: Beginner-friendly GUI
- **VS Code**: Built-in Git integration
- **Sourcetree**: Free visual Git client

### **Practice Commands Safely**
```bash
# Create a test repository to practice
mkdir git-practice
cd git-practice
git init
echo "Hello" > test.txt
git add test.txt
git commit -m "First commit"

# Practice branching, merging, conflicts safely here
```

### **Useful Aliases** (Optional)
Add to your `~/.gitconfig`:
```ini
[alias]
    st = status
    co = checkout
    br = branch
    ci = commit
    unstage = reset HEAD --
    last = log -1 HEAD
    visual = !gitk
```

## üéØ Key Takeaways

1. **Sync early, sync often** - Pull from main before starting work and regularly during development
2. **Small commits** - One logical change per commit with descriptive messages
3. **Communicate** - Let team know when editing shared files
4. **Test after conflicts** - Always run tests after resolving merge conflicts
5. **Backup your work** - Push frequently, even work-in-progress
6. **Don't panic** - Git rarely loses data, there's usually a way to recover

**Remember**: The best way to handle conflicts is to prevent them in the first place! üöÄ

## üìä Common Workflow Patterns

### **Feature Development Pattern**
```bash
# 1. Start fresh
git checkout main && git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# 2. Develop iteratively
# Make small changes
git add . && git commit -m "Step 1: Add basic structure"
# More changes
git add . && git commit -m "Step 2: Add validation logic"
# Continue...

# 3. Stay synced
git checkout main && git pull origin main
git checkout feature/new-feature && git merge main

# 4. Push and PR
git push origin feature/new-feature
# Create Pull Request on GitHub
```

### **Bug Fix Pattern**
```bash
# 1. Create fix branch from main
git checkout main && git pull origin main
git checkout -b fix/issue-description

# 2. Make minimal changes
git add specific-files
git commit -m "Fix: description of what was broken and how it's fixed"

# 3. Test thoroughly
npm run test

# 4. Quick merge
git push origin fix/issue-description
# Create PR for quick review
```

### **Configuration Update Pattern**
```bash
# 1. Check what others are doing
git log --oneline -10 -- playwright.config.ts

# 2. Pull latest
git checkout main && git pull origin main
git checkout -b config/update-description

# 3. Make focused change
git add playwright.config.ts
git commit -m "Config: specific change description"

# 4. Test and push immediately
npm run test
git push origin config/update-description
```

## üîÑ Conflict Resolution Examples

### **Example 1: Simple Configuration Conflict**
```javascript
// Before resolution (conflict markers visible)
export default defineConfig({
<<<<<<< HEAD
  timeout: 45 * 1000,  // Your change: increased timeout
=======
  timeout: 30 * 1000,  // Their change: kept original
>>>>>>> main
  retries: 1,
});

// After resolution (markers removed, decision made)
export default defineConfig({
  timeout: 45 * 1000,  // Keep the increased timeout
  retries: 1,
});
```

### **Example 2: Test Data Conflict**
```json
// Before resolution
{
  "users": [
<<<<<<< HEAD
    {"email": "test1@example.com", "role": "admin"},
    {"email": "test2@example.com", "role": "user"}
=======
    {"email": "qa-user@example.com", "role": "tester"}
>>>>>>> main
  ]
}

// After resolution (combine both)
{
  "users": [
    {"email": "test1@example.com", "role": "admin"},
    {"email": "test2@example.com", "role": "user"},
    {"email": "qa-user@example.com", "role": "tester"}
  ]
}
```

## üîç Real-World Case Study: GitHub Actions Workflow Conflict

### **The Problem: CI/CD Pipeline Failure with Merge Conflicts**

**Situation**: A GitHub Actions workflow was failing with the error:
```
cp: cannot stat 'node_modules/@playwright/test/lib/traceViewer/web/*': No such file or directory
```

**Context**: 
- Feature branch `Github` had fixes for a broken Playwright trace viewer setup
- Main branch still contained the old, problematic configuration
- Pull request showed merge conflicts in two critical files

### **Why This Happened**

1. **Outdated File Paths**: The workflow used hardcoded paths to Playwright's internal files that changed between versions
2. **Complex Custom Setup**: Instead of using Playwright's built-in capabilities, the workflow tried to manually copy trace viewer assets
3. **Parallel Development**: Multiple developers working on CI/CD improvements simultaneously
4. **Version Mismatch**: Playwright 1.53.1 had different internal structure than expected

### **The Investigation Process**

#### **Step 1: Identify the Root Cause**
```bash
# First, we examined the failing workflow
cat .github/workflows/playwright-chrome-tests.yml | grep -A 10 "trace"

# Found the problematic line:
# cp -r node_modules/@playwright/test/lib/traceViewer/web/* github-pages-site/viewer/
```

#### **Step 2: Check Playwright Version and Structure**
```bash
# Checked what version we're using
cat package.json | grep playwright
# Result: "@playwright/test": "^1.53.1"

# Tried to locate the actual trace viewer files
find node_modules/@playwright -name "*trace*" -type d
# Result: Path didn't exist in newer Playwright versions
```

#### **Step 3: Analyze the Conflict**
```bash
# Compared the differences between branches
git diff origin/main HEAD -- .github/workflows/playwright-chrome-tests.yml
git diff origin/main HEAD -- playwright.config.ts

# Found that the Github branch had the correct simplified fixes
# Main branch still had the broken complex setup
```

### **The Resolution Strategy**

#### **Option Analysis**
We considered three approaches:
1. **Disable trace viewer** - Quick fix but loses functionality
2. **Fix the file paths** - Fragile, depends on Playwright internals
3. **Simplify using built-in features** ‚úÖ - Robust, future-proof

#### **Implementation Steps**

**Step 1: Simplify Playwright Configuration**
```typescript
// OLD: Complex conditional logic
trace: process.env.CI && process.env.ENABLE_TRACE_VIEWER === 'true' ? 'retain-on-failure' : 'off',

// NEW: Simple, always-on approach
trace: 'retain-on-failure',  // Generate traces on failure
```

**Step 2: Simplify GitHub Actions Workflow**
```yaml
# REMOVED: 80+ lines of complex trace viewer setup
# REPLACED WITH: Simple copy operation
- name: Prepare report for GitHub Pages
  if: always()
  run: |
    mkdir -p github-pages-site
    cp -r playwright-report/* github-pages-site/
```

**Step 3: Resolve Merge Conflicts**
```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Merge the fixes from Github branch
git merge Github

# Resolve conflicts by choosing the fixed versions
git checkout --theirs .github/workflows/playwright-chrome-tests.yml
git checkout --theirs playwright.config.ts

# Commit the resolution
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts: Use simplified Playwright workflow and trace configuration"

# Push the fix
git push origin main
```

### **Key Lessons Learned**

#### **Technical Lessons**
1. **Avoid depending on internal file structures** - They can change between versions
2. **Prefer built-in solutions** over custom implementations
3. **Keep CI/CD configurations simple** - Complexity leads to brittleness
4. **Test configuration changes** in isolation before merging

#### **Workflow Lessons**
1. **Communicate major changes** - CI/CD modifications affect everyone
2. **Use feature flags** for experimental features rather than complex conditionals
3. **Document breaking changes** in commit messages
4. **Review dependencies** when upgrading versions

### **Prevention Strategies**

#### **For Future CI/CD Changes**
```bash
# Before modifying shared workflow files
git pull origin main  # Get latest changes
git log --oneline -10 -- .github/workflows/  # Check recent changes

# Make changes in small, testable increments
git checkout -b ci/improve-trace-handling
# Make one focused change
git commit -m "Simplify trace collection configuration"
# Test in PR before merging
```

#### **For Dependency Updates**
```bash
# When updating Playwright or other tools
# 1. Check changelog for breaking changes
# 2. Test locally first
# 3. Update configuration incrementally
# 4. Document any required workflow changes
```

#### **Team Communication Protocol**
- **Announce CI/CD changes** in team chat before starting
- **Create small, focused PRs** for infrastructure changes
- **Test changes** in feature branches before merging
- **Document** any manual steps required after deployment

### **The Fix in Action**

**Before** (Broken):
- Complex 100+ line workflow with manual file copying
- Dependency on internal Playwright file structure
- Conditional logic based on environment variables
- Fragile and version-dependent

**After** (Working):
- Simple 10-line workflow using built-in capabilities
- No dependency on internal file paths
- Automatic trace generation on test failures
- Robust and future-proof

**Result**: 
- ‚úÖ GitHub Actions workflow runs successfully
- ‚úÖ Test reports include interactive trace viewing
- ‚úÖ No more missing file errors
- ‚úÖ Simpler maintenance going forward

### **Code Snippets for Reference**

**Fixed Playwright Config**:
```typescript
use: {
  trace: 'retain-on-failure',  // Always generate traces on failure
  screenshot: 'only-on-failure',
  video: process.env.CI ? 'off' : 'retain-on-failure',
}
```

**Fixed Workflow Step**:
```yaml
- name: Prepare report for GitHub Pages
  if: always()
  run: |
    mkdir -p github-pages-site
    cp -r playwright-report/* github-pages-site/
```

This case demonstrates how **simplicity beats complexity** in CI/CD workflows and the importance of **using tools as intended** rather than building custom workarounds.

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Git Techniques

### **Interactive Rebase (Advanced)**
```bash
# Clean up commit history before pushing
git rebase -i HEAD~3  # Edit last 3 commits

# In the editor, you can:
# - squash: combine commits
# - reword: change commit message
# - drop: remove commit entirely
```

### **Cherry-picking (Selective Merge)**
```bash
# Apply specific commit from another branch
git checkout target-branch
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

### **Stashing Work**
```bash
# Save work without committing
git stash push -m "Work in progress on feature X"

# List stashes
git stash list

# Apply stash
git stash pop

# Apply specific stash
git stash apply stash@{1}
```
